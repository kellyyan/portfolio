                        <p>
                            F*ck it Denim (FID), a startup that makes jeans that fit all body types, needed a coming soon page and visual identity for their site. The founder, Michelle, wanted it to stand out amongst other clothing brands and be bold and catchy to fit with the brand name. The developer had created a design for the coming soon page but it was visually unappealing and did not draw customers in.

                        <h3 className='h3'>RESEARCH</h3>
                        <p>My boss gave me examples of websites she liked and whose general style she wanted to imitate such as <a className='a' href='https://yourparade.com' target='_blank'>Parade</a> and <a className='a' href='https://starface.world/' target='_blank'>Starface</a>.
                        <br />
                        The target audience was women in their early 20s who are looking to purchase closet staples. Through my research, I found that the demographic gravitated toward fun and casual branding, with a preference towards warm colors.
                        <br />

                    <div className='section'>
                        <h3 className='h3'>SOLUTION</h3>
                        <p>
                            Under the instructions of my boss who wanted an unconventional primary color within the branding, I chose a neon green as the primary color coupled with easy to read sans-serif fonts.

                        <div className='image-with-caption center'>
                            <img className='image-scale' src={branding} alt=''></img>

                        <h3 className='h3'>LOW FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
                        <p>I then created the low fidelity wireframes for the site layout with all the necessary content needed. I recieved approval from my boss and then moved onto the high fidelity iterations.</p>

                        <p>
                            I created high fidelity wireframes, with illustrations created in Adobe Illustrator. I went through various iterations and presented to my boss
                            designs with different color options, so she could help choose the best one. I implemented feedback from her until we produced a satisfying final result.

                        <h3 className='h3'>DELIVERABLE</h3>
                        <p>
                            My final deliverable was the wireframe design which I presented to the developer.

                                The internship gave me an opportunity to design for a buisness in a professional capacity. I gained skills such as not taking feedback personally and working with others to iterate until a satisfactory design is produced.
